This Privacy Policy applies only to information that you provide to us through both Sites. This Privacy Policy may be updated from time to time. We will notify you of any material changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on the Site. You are advised to consult this policy regularly for any changes. Unless otherwise defined in this Privacy Policy, terms used in this Privacy Policy have the same meanings as in our Mentorverse Terms of Service, accessible at mentorverse.us/terms</p>
